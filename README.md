This R script is used to extract and transform data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set". Original documentation on this dataset can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#

The run_analysis.R script is used to transform data from the original zip file to a tidy dataset with standard deviation and mean components listed with their corresponding source activity. 

Please see the CodeBook.md and clean_doc.rd files for additional detailed information and instructions to run the script.
